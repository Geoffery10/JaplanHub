                    <h2>The Why</h2>
                    <hr>
                    <h3>Why Am I Sending Money to Geoffery?</h3>
                    <p><strong>1. Centralized Purchases:</strong> Geoffery will
                        be managing all major group expenses, including train
                        passes, accommodations, flights, and any additional
                        passes or costs that may arise. Pooling our funds allows
                        us to secure group housing and make coordinated
                        bookings, making the logistics of our trip more
                        seamless.</p>
                    <p><strong>2. Currency Distribution:</strong> To enhance
                        convenience during our travels, we plan to distribute
                        funds in Japanese Yen. While you can still use your
                        personal funds if you prefer, having a common pool
                        ensures that everyone has enough resources for the
                        entire trip without unexpected financial hiccups.</p>
                    <h3>Detailed Breakdown</h3>
                    <p>For a comprehensive breakdown of how your money will be
                        utilized and spent, please refer to the planning
                        spreadsheet accessible <a
                            href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-UiayTDymejAxi2tsQvdXQvYJ4d0z53UehOFfQrk5U4/edit?usp=sharing"

                    <h3>Need Further Clarification?</h3>
                    <p>If you have any additional questions or concerns, feel
                        free to reach out to Geoffery, Raeanne, or Connor on
                        Discord. We're here to assist and ensure that everyone
                        is well-informed and comfortable with the financial
                        arrangements.</p>
                    <h2>The How</h2>
                    <hr>
                    <h3>Two Options</h3>
                    <p>There are two options: PayPal or Cash/Check
                        You will see more info on each below but here is the
                        quick break down.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>PayPal is the preferred option as it allows us to
                            transfer funds quickly and with identifiable
                            "Japlan" messages.</li>
                        <li>For those who prefer cash or checks, please write
                            "Japlan" on the memo line when making your payment
                            to Geoffery. This will help ensure proper tracking
                            and organization of our Japlan finances. Just be
                            aware cash in particular is harder to keep track of
                            since there is no receipt.</li>

                    <p><strong>Note:</strong> While cash and checks are
                        acceptable, they are harder to track as there is no
                        receipt. Please keep track of your own payments if
                        possible.</p>
