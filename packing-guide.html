                            Summer in Japan can vary, and looking at past
                            weather
                            trends, the average
                            temperature for July is anywhere between 80¬∞F-71¬∞F.

                            For reference, this

                            should
                            note that June is Japan's
                            rainy season, and that <em>can</em> merge into July

                        <h2>The Everyday Bag üéíüí≥</h2>
                        <p>
                            An everyday bag will greatly help while going out
                            and
                            exploring. Most likely
                            this will not be packed in your suitcase and will be
                            carried with you to the
                            airport. This can consist of a purse, fanny pack, or
                            even a drawstring bag. If
                            you chose a purse, try and find a crossbody bag.
                            Crossbodies and fanny packs
                            will be considered part of your person, and not a
                            personal item. A purse or a
                            drawstring bag might need to go into your personal
                            item
                            until you are passed
                            TSA. Here is what should be in your everyday bag for
                            both on the plane and while
                            walking around Japan.
