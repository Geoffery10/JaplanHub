## The Suitcase 🧳👗

Please note that the places we will be staying at **WILL** have a washing machine on the property for us to use. You **DO NOT** need to pack an outfit for every single day. I recommend the 5-4-3-2-1 Packing Method. Packing cubes or self vacuum sealing bags for your suitcase can also help maximize your limited space (and, of course, allow room for souvenirs.)

### Following the 5-4-3-2-1 Packing Method, here is one possible example of what to pack in terms of clothing for July in Japan:

- [ ] **5 Tops:**
    - [ ] 5 Tee-Shirts or Tank tops (modest and respectful)
- [ ] **4 Bottoms:**
    - [ ] 2 Pants ( choose breathable fabrics such as Cotton or Linen)
    - [ ] 2 Shorts (longer inseam for modesty)
- [ ] **3 Shoes and Optional 3 Dresses:**
    - Shoes worn to the airport plus 2 others (easy to take off at temples and comfortable for lots of walking, if you pack sandals you should make sure to carry socks with you when you wear them)
    - [ ] Optional 3 dresses for a touch of summer flair
- [ ] **2 Swimsuits and 2 Jackets:**
    - 1 or 2 swimsuits for pools, beaches, or hot tubs (Some of the places we will stay will have hot tubs 🛁🔥)
    - 2 lightweight jackets, especially a rain jacket
- [ ] **1 Hat, Sunglasses, and a Bag:**
    - Hat and sunglasses for daytime travels
    - A foldable bag for the days away from Tokyo, we will be leaving a majority of our luggage at the villa while we go to Osaka and Kyoto. Make sure this bag can carry 4 days worth of clothes.

Along with this, you will pack any needed **undergarments and socks**, along with around **2-4 sets of sleep clothes**. Summer in Japan can vary, and looking at past weather trends, the average temperature for July is anywhere between 80°F-71°F. 🌞👚 For reference, this past summer Tokyo saw a low of 70°f and a high of 90°f, and the summer before saw a low of 75°f and a high of 95°f. You also should note that June is Japan's rainy season, and that _can_ merge into July as well. **_It is recommended you pack a small travel umbrella or purchase one in Japan._**

## The Everyday Bag 🎒💳

An everyday bag will greatly help while going out and exploring. Most likely this will not be packed in your suitcase and will be carried with you to the airport. This can consist of a purse, fanny pack, or even a drawstring bag. If you chose a purse, try and find a crossbody bag. Crossbodies and fanny packs will be considered part of your person, and not a personal item. A purse or a drawstring bag might need to go into your personal item until you are passed TSA. Here is what should be in your everyday bag for both on the plane and while walking around Japan.

### Everyday Bag Essentials:

- [ ] Wallet:
    - [ ] Cash
        - **You will be given Japanese Yen to spend daily**
        - Japan is mostly a cash based society still so this will be your main form of payment.
    - [ ] Debit card/credit card
        - Be sure to check if your cards work in Japan and don’t have ridiculous transaction fees.
- [ ] Passport
    - Keep this on your person at all times when not in our lodgings
- [ ] Battery Bank and Charge Cable
- Suica Card/JR pass (We get in Japan)
- [ ] Small umbrella (Can be purchased in Japan)
- [ ] Plastic bags for garbage
- [ ] Blister pads
- Travel Folder (Provided by the Team)

## Random Items 🌂🛍️

A few random items that you could buy while in Japan but you should consider packing as well:

- [ ] Small laundry kit (make sure it is TSA approved, this would go into your toiletry bag)
- [ ] Small-medium bag to carry with your everyday bag, for anything such as your umbrella, water bottle, sunscreen and souvenirs.
